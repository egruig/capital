debt is just a tool

anyone's debt is someone else's asset

if that debt is used to finance consumption, that ultmately becomes deflationary in terms of your borrowing forward demand - you're increasing my consumption today, lowering it in the future as I face repayment of debt

but if that same debt is used to expand production and to expand the capacity of the economy, then it can have a totally different dynamic
