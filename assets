assets VS money conflict

if you buy bonds (government), you choose to be long the currency

if you buy stocks (blue chips), you're gonna be shorting the currency

that's your choice : am I gonna be long currency or am I gonna be long assets ?

with the weaker currency you get to sell more, the economy booms much better

if the currency is gonna be high in value then the assets are gonna go down
